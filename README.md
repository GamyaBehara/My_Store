Perfect 👍 I’ll create a **README.md** for your **E-commerce project (My Store)** in the same style and tone as your ISRO Showcase README.
Since I don’t have full project details, I’ll assume a **React-based frontend e-commerce app** and keep it polished and professional.
You can later swap in your own demo link, screenshots, and tech stack if needed.
